"""Reading and changing the N64 Video Interface configuration inside a ROM.

The blur people dislike on real hardware is mostly not anti-aliasing. The VI has
a dedither filter, bit 16 of VI_CTRL, whose job is to reconstruct a 32-bit image
from a dithered 16-bit framebuffer, and it is that filter which softens the
picture. Edge anti-aliasing, bits 9:8, is a separate thing.

The two are coupled in hardware. The dedither filter only behaves correctly when
AA_MODE is REPLICATE or AA_ALWAYS, so libultra's `osViSetSpecialFeatures` forces
AA_MODE when the filter is switched on and restores it from the mode table when
switched off. That is why turning the filter off is the small, safe change and
clearing AA_MODE is the larger one that trades softness for shimmer.

Two places in a ROM decide this:

  the VI mode table, an array of OSViMode structs the game hands to the library,
  whose ctrl field holds the values above

  osViSetSpecialFeatures itself, which masks those bits at runtime according to
  what the game asks for

This module locates both by signature rather than by per-game offsets, so one
implementation covers any title built against the standard library. Every field
name and bit position below is from the published hardware documentation, and the
mode table signature was verified against retail ROMs before being relied on.
